# Bobtail Assignment

A asssignment from Bobtail company. 

- Email/Password Sign-In through firebase.
- Fetching food data from Firebase.
- I have added ramndom foods to firebase named 'food'.
- I have used 3 filter types as guided.
- Used GetX as state managment tool.

# Note

Hopefully you will see my logic of data binding and mapping. Also you'll be noticing the defained and clean structure of application rather than dummy data that I have filled on Firestore :)
